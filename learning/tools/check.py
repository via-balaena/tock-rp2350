"""Quality gate for the learning series.

For every chapter directory under learning/ this runs:

  1. Static checks on the page  - duplicate ids, unbalanced tags, JavaScript
     reaching for ids that do not exist, CSS variables used but never defined,
     and colors hardcoded outside the theme token blocks (which is the classic
     way an artifact ends up unreadable in one of the two themes). Also the
     WCAG contrast of every foreground-on-background pair in both themes, that
     the OS-dark and toggled-dark palettes agree, heading order, and whether
     ARIA roles are backed by the behavior they promise.

  2. Pedagogy checks           - every load-bearing term is marked <dfn> at or
     before its first bare use in the prose and carried in the glossary, no
     sentence runs past the length a reader can hold or introduces more new
     vocabulary than it can carry, and only a small share of the prose is
     allowed to hide behind a click.

  3. Behavioral checks         - the page's own <script> is executed headlessly
     against the DOM shim in harness.js, then the chapter's assertions in
     tools/<chapter-prefix>.tests.js run against the resulting state.

Run from the repository root:

    python3 learning/tools/check.py

Exits non-zero if anything fails, so it can gate a commit.

    `citation_chain_checks` asks whether a cited line exists. It says so

    it meant are in `kernel/src/kernel.rs`. Every hand check of these citations
    read them from a list with explicit paths, so the chain itself was never
    the thing being tested -- and a reader following the bibliography is the
    only one who would ever have found it.

    So: resolve each `:N` back to the last path actually named, and ask the

    Chapter 4's Figure 5 said "every address on this chip, in one list" and
    listed twelve. At the commit the chapter was re-pinned to, the chip crate
    had eighteen `StaticRef::new` calls: the re-pin added SPI, DMA and PIO, and
    the figure kept saying twelve. Every one of its twelve citations still
    resolved, so `citation_chain_checks` was happy; a citation check asks
    whether what a page says is there, and never whether something else is.

    The figure now carries its inventory as `var MAP = [...]` with one entry
    per address and the file:line that names it. This counts the real
    `StaticRef::new` call sites per file at the pinned commit and requires the
    figure to cite every file that has one, and to cite it as many distinct
    lines as it has calls. It does not require one entry per call, because two
    of PIO's calls are a `const fn` that three call sites turn into fifteen
    addresses -- that gap is the figure's whole point, so the check counts
    lines cited, not entries.

    -- that is what the family means on these pages -- so its rule has to say
    what happens to case. Requiring the declaration rather than a particular
    value keeps the rule loose: a component is free to answer `uppercase` if it
    means it, and only silence is refused.

def boot_state_checks(html):
    """The figure a reader meets with scripting off is the markup's own state.

    A figure that declares an opening state declares it twice: in the markup,
    so the page reads with no JavaScript, and in the script, which reproduces
    it on load. The behavioural tests only ever see the second, because the
    script has run by the time they look, so the markup half can drift
    unnoticed. Figure 15 shipped a listing whose opening line was not the one
    its panel showed, and only a screenshot caught it.

    Selection is spelled two ways on this page, and for a while this scan knew
    only one of them. `is-on` marks the chosen panel in Figures 3, 4, 7 and 15;
    `is-lit` does the same job in Figures 1, 2 and 3. Reading only `is-on` made
    the scan silently skip every `is-lit` figure -- proven by moving the lit
    panel in Figure 7 and in Figure 1 and watching only the first get caught.
    Both tokens count now. The token was only half of it: the scan also read
    attributes positionally, requiring `class=` before `id=`, so Figure 1's
    `<g id="svg-byte" class="cast-el">` stayed invisible whatever its classes
    said. Fixing the token alone left the mutation still escaping, which is the
    argument for putting the defect back rather than reasoning about the patch.
    Attributes come out of the tag in either order now.

    Note what this still does not mean: Figures 1 and 2 deliberately mark
    nothing in the markup, because un-highlighted is a fine way for them to
    read with no scripting, and a figure that declares no opening state is not
    required to.

    The invariant checked is the one that cannot be argued with: where a set of
    buttons and a set of panels inside one figure share suffixes --
    `dl-and`/`dp-and`, `hd-0`/`hxr-0`, `rg-2`/`rgn-2` -- the pressed button and
    the shown panel must be the same one.

    Three things the scan has to allow for, each of which produced a false
    alarm first. Independent toggles are not a one-of-many group, so a set with
    no matching panels is skipped -- Figure 4's four bit switches are meant to
    be three-quarters pressed. A group may carry an extra control on the same
    prefix, so the panels need only be a subset of the buttons, which is what
    lets Figure 7's `rg-twins` sit beside `rg-0`..`rg-7`. And a set where no
    panel is marked shown is the other legitimate pattern: Figure 14's cases
    are all visible until the script puts four away, so no scripting means all
    five rather than none. Figures are scanned one at a time, because `hd-*`
    and `rgn-*` both run 0 to 7 and have nothing to do with each other.

# The promise ledger.
#
# Two of the three findings in chapter 3's third review pass were the same
# shape: one chapter says something about another chapter, and the other
# chapter does not back it up. Chapter 1's Figure 6 promised "Chapter 3 opens
# them up" of two things and chapter 3 opened one. Figure 7 said all six
# instructions were ones the reader had already met, and one of them appears
# nowhere else in the series.
#
# That class only gets worse from here. Chapter 3 alone makes fourteen claims
# about what chapter 1 says, and chapter 1 was rewritten heavily after chapter
# 2 was drafted -- seven passages were converted from prose to tables, ten
# openings were cut. Any one of those edits could have taken away a sentence
# chapter 3 cites, and nothing would have said so.
#
# What a machine can check here is narrow, and pretending otherwise would be
# worse than not checking. It cannot read a chapter and decide whether a debt
# is honoured. It can insist that every cross-reference is written down, that
# what the ledger says a chapter says is still there, and that a chapter which
# has shipped contains the text its creditors were promised. The judgement
# stays with the author; the bookkeeping does not.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Vocabulary the series leans on.
#
# The existing rule is bidirectional but narrow: every term a chapter marks
# <dfn> has to be in its glossary, and vice versa. It has nothing to say about a
# word the chapter uses constantly and never marks at all.
#
# Chapter 4 used `crate` fourteen times, and its central argument turns on it --
# "what makes it legal there and illegal here is only which crate it sits in".
# It used `process` twelve times, all load-bearing, three chapters before the
# one that explains what a process is. Neither was defined anywhere in the
# series, and nothing noticed, because both rules were satisfied: the terms were
# never marked, so they were never required in a glossary.
#
# A word used this often is load-bearing whether or not the author noticed. The
# threshold is deliberately blunt.
