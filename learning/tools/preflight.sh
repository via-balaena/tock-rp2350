# Each of these has caught a real defect that the chapter's own gate could not
# see. The toc one is the reason this script exists at all: `tools/ci/toc.sh`
# selects Markdown by grepping for markdown-toc's insertion marker and then
# rewrites what it finds, so learning/README.md -- which had written that
# marker out in order to describe it -- would have had a table of contents
# inserted into the middle of a bullet list and then been reported as out of
# date. Twelve review passes went green locally before anyone ran it, because
# markdown-toc is not installed here.
#
# What this cannot do is in learning/README.md, under "Before committing".
